Types of data in general:

---> Numerical data: Continuous(in interval ranges) and discrete
---> Categorical data: Binary and ordinal(contain some order in it)

1. Numerical data - Data that are expressed on a numeric scale.

  1.1 Continuous data: Data that can take on any value in an interval. 
  1.2 Discrete data: Data that can take on only integer values, such as counts. 

2. Categorical data - Data that can take on only a specific set of values representing a set of possible
                      categories. 
                      
  2.1 Binary: A special case of categorical data with just two categories of values, e.g., 0/1,
              true/false.
  2.2 Ordinal: Categorical data that has an explicit ordering.
